With a proven track record of delivering high-quality services and maintaining strong client relationships, GBI has built a reputation for reliability and expertise.

The recruitment industry faces significant challenges in terms of time and resource management. Research shows that screening resumes alone takes about 23 hours per hire [EddySoftware], while the total person-hours for hiring average around 100 hours per hire [LinkedIn]. Manual tasks—including resume screening, interviewing, and skills testing—consume over 50% of hiring time. These inefficiencies in the hiring process create a pressing need for innovative solutions.
 
Following this introduction, we will outline the problem addressed by our project and present the proposed solution, providing context for the work carried out during this internship.
